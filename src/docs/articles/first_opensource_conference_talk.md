I attend India's Biggest Open-Source conference FOSS.IN from 2007, and in 2009, in the same conference, I started contributing to KDE/Kate project.

I wrote Tabify plugin for Kate editor and also submitted a few patches to kate and KDE. Then I got lazy and didn't do much significant contributions.

And again the Foss.in season arrived and I thought why not give a talk on Kate plugin in Foss.in KDE day. There are not much Kate contributors in India and I can share what I learnt and we can get more contributors in Kate too. That seemed to be an inspiring idea.

But I got disappointed since this year KDE day's plan was dropped and I decided to drop my plan as well!! But thanks to people at my office ( VCL team ) for forcing me to do the presentation and finally I applied for the talk.

Eventually my talk got selected and I became a speaker at Foss.in. On 16th Dec 2010 at 11 am I gave my talk on "Writing plugins for Kate and enhancing Kate".

Here is the presentation.
