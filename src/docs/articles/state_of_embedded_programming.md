I am engineer with a love of solving problems using both the hardware and software sides where required. Been playing with computers & micro controllers for almost a decade â€¦ 

I have been playing with microcontrollers for over  a decade and have developed normal desktop and web applications too. When I started playing with microcontroller I had many questions like 
- If I have to do so much of coding to get just one LED to light up on this tiny hardware then why is it so easy to get a entire string printed on monitor in my desktop application ?
- What is happening under the hood of printf function? because when I connect simple character lcd to my 8 bit microcontroller I have to write entire driver to print simple character on it. 
- Same goes for scanf...

After exploring different parts of computer and embedded system I am trying the answer my own questions based on my experience in the series of Articles.
