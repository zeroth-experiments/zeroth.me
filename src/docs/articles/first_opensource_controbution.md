My new year started with a bang .. completing one item from my wish list i.e contribute to a Open-Source project.

I have started contributing to KDE Kate. My 1st patch accepted for BUG No. [184055](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184055) which is now in kde 4.4 :). Hurray ...

About the fix:
Problem : Previously in Kate's document view the last added file was not getting sorted as per the given sorting option.
Solution: Whenever user open the file call the document views sorting.

* for more details  here is the [bug description](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=184055).

Though it was really small bug fix it was really a good learning experience. I will try to be consistent with contributing to KDE :).
